Over the same time period, software developers have come to identify immutability as a simplifying tool that helps the creation of concurrent and distributed systems. In this talk, we'll learn about immutability, a concept from functional programming. By learning about structural sharing, immutable views, and simplified diagnostic debugging, we'll see how we can leverage this concept in order to improve the performance and effectiveness of NoSQL data models and schema design.",
